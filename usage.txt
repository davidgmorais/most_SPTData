GENERATE MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCES:

Description:    Solves the vertex correspondence problem of multiple polygons present in the working
                directory.

Working dir:    Directory path to be used in generation of multiple correspondences. The directory
                should contain .wkt files starting in 0, where in each is the WKT of the polygon in
                each frame. The working directory can also contain a folder named simplifications (or
                the name defined in the config file) where simplified version of the WKTs should be found.

Options:        -h --help
                Display help and exit.

                -b --bbox
                Use bounding box method to generate feature points and correspondences instead of the
                default method.

                -o --output-file
                JSON filename where the output correspondences should be stored in the working directory,
                in GEO-JSON format.

                -c --config-file
                Path to the configuration file to be used, which should be a JSON file containing the
                fields 'max_angle', 'min_angle', 'd_min', 'd_max' and 'simplification_folder'. If any or
                all of these values are absent, default values are used.  (If the bbox method is used,
                there is no need to be used a config file)


GENERATE MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCES BASED ON A MAN:TRACK FILE:

Description:   Solves the vertex correspondence problem of multiple polygons present in the working
                directory, in a tree structure, using the help of a man_track file (this method is mainly
                used when the problem is being applied to cells os bodies which require tree structure to
                be presented/solved).

Working dir:    Directory path to be used in multiple correspondences. The directory should contain subdirectories
                starting in 0, which represent each frame, and inside each there should be .wkt
                files, starting in 0, one for each polygon of a body.

man_track:      Man_track_file in the format presented by celltrackingchallenge.net, where the first
                column represents a label, the second and third columns represent the frame at which they
                first and lastly appear on, respectively, and the last columns representing the label of
                its parent.

Options:        -h --help
                Display help and exit.

                -b --bbox
                Use bounding box method to generate feature points and correspondences instead of the
                default method (in this case, this method is recommended)

                -o --output-file
                JSON filename where the output correspondences should be stored in the working directory,
                in GEO-JSON format.

                -c --config-file
                Path to the configuration file to be used, which should be a JSON file containing the
                fields 'max_angle', 'min_angle', 'd_min', 'd_max' and 'simplification_folder'. If any or
                all of these values are absent, default values are used. (If the bbox method is used, there
                is no need to be used a config file)


GENERATE SINGLE CORRESPONDENCE:

Description:    Solves the vertex correspondence problem of a single polygon pair.

Source_file:    Path to the .wkt file containing the source polygon to be used in the vcp.

Target_file:    Path to the .wkt file containing the target polygon to be used in the vcp.

Options:        -h --help
                Display help and exit.

                -b --bbox
                Use bounding box method to generate feature points and correspondences instead of the
                default method.

                -s --source-simplification
                Path to the .wkt simplified version of the source polygon to help in the generation of
                feature points

                -t --target-simplification
                Path to the .wkt simplified version of the target polygon to help in the generation of
                feature points

                -c --config-file
                Path to the configuration file to be used, which should be a JSON file containing the
                fields 'max_angle', 'min_angle', 'd_min', 'd_max' and 'simplification_folder'. (In this
                case, there is no need to contain a 'simplification_folder' field).
